The following documentation is intended to outline and explain the core content, technical approach, implementation aspects, and development issues regarding the final project for the second module of "Computational Management of Data" course - namely "Data Science" - held within the "Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge" Master's Degree at Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna. The project has been developed by: Luca Scotti, Eliza Stuglik and Mariachiara Giorgi.

The main purpose is to develop an information system by mean of a set of software technologies. The general idea, specified within the guidelines provided by the lecturer, can be considered as the integration of three different - although cumulative - steps:
1) Uploading and processing data stored in two distinct data format, namely Comma Separated Value (CSV) and Java Script Object Notation (JSON).
2) Generate and populate databases in accordance with two different DBMS data model - relational and graph.
3) Define a set of formal instructions able to query and retrieve the information embedded into the databases.

The whole process has to be managed by a Python environment.
